                methods: "A CNN model was trained on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The model was converted to TensorFlow Lite and deployed. Inference times and CPU load were benchmarked for both CPU-only and TPU-accelerated execution.",
                result: "The Edge TPU provided a 15-20x speedup in inference time, enabling real-time packet processing at higher network speeds. CPU usage on the Pi dropped from ~90% to under 15% during inference.",
                advantages: "Drastic performance improvement for complex models, frees up host CPU for other tasks, enables real-time high-throughput analysis on low-power devices.",

                year: "2022",
                methodology: "A two-stage hybrid IDS was proposed for edge nodes. The first stage uses a lightweight signature-based method (AdaBoost) for known attacks, passing suspicious traffic to a deep autoencoder for zero-day anomaly detection.",
                methods: "Deployed on a Raspberry Pi acting as a mobile edge node. AdaBoost was trained on known attack signatures, while the autoencoder was trained on benign traffic to learn a baseline. A risk score determines the final classification.",

                advantages: "Balances performance and accuracy, good at detecting both signature-based and anomaly-based threats, efficient for resource-constrained edge devices.",
